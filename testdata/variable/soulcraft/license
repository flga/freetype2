Soulcraft typeface is a free OpenType variable font designed with the idea of emulating vernacular lettering. Since the font is an OTVar font, the user is able to change width and slant of each individual character without relying on pre-defined font weights. This enables to replicate some quirky characteristics found in the drawing of sans-serif letters in street signs and walls, giving an energetic, unapologetic and dynamic feeling to the compositions made with the font.

Our goal was to create a typeface to encourage all of us. Soulcraft is available to everyone for free, empowering creative people to make use of it in the most varied ways to express themselves in a bold, raw and unafraid voice. By being variable, the font gives the possibility to do so many different kinds of work with a single file. Itâ€™s like having a toolbox in just one typeface.
