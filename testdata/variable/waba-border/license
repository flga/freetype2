Waba Border A basic nouveau-style border is also available for free as a Variable Font. This border was a bit of an experiment so it isn't super developed, but it works. The file is coded so beginning and end glyphs are generated automatically, then a repeating set of middle glyphs will appear, with each tap of any letter. A centre piece glyph of a face can be added manually through the Glyphs panel. Make sure you have your Contextual Alternates turned on and know how to use Variable Fonts. The border can be adjusted in width and weight to suit your taste using the Variable axes sliders.
